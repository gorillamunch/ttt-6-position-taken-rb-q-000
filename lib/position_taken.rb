  # basic solution:

  # taken = nil
  # if (board[position] ==  " " || board[position] == "" || board[position] == nil)
  #   taken = false
  # else
  #   taken = true
  # end
  # taken

  # advanced solution w/ ternary operator
  (board[position] ==  " " || board[position] == "" || board[position] == nil) ?
    false : true

end
